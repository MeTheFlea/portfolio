title : Post-processing Effects
tech:
- C++
- GLSL
desc : 
 "A simple island scene with animated water and a day/night cycle. Though this is a basic scene, this project mainly focused on post-processing effects and manipulating frame buffers to layer multiple camera effects so that they all work simultaneously."
features : 
 "<ul>
 	<li>Heavy use of GLSL.</li>
 	<li>Multiple frame-buffers to layer post-process effects.</li>
 	<li>Dynamic day-night cycle with dynamic sun.</li>
 	<li>Water with reflections, refractions and Beer's Law.</li>
 	<li>Dynamic lens flares.</li>
 	<li>Depth of field with some slight artifact correction.</li>
 	<li>Interpolated keyframes on a vertex-animated model.</li>
 	<li>Smooth animation transitions on a vertex-animated model.</li>
 </ul>"
