 Description :
 - "A group project consisting of 3 programmers (including myself) and 5 designers. The purpose of this game was to get a hold of some experimental technologies, and combine them. Using both the Kinect 2.0 and an Oculus Rift, the goal of the game is to direct traffic safely through a crossroad by gesturing either &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;go&quot; to each of the three lanes."
 - "Our team was also invited to the <i>Microsoft TechDays 2015</i> event to showcase the game."
 - "Visit the <b><a href=\"http://blindtrafficcontrol.com\">website</a></b>!"

 Responsibilities :
 - "As one of the three programmers, I mainly worked on integrating the Kinect into the game, as well as building a gesture database for it to recognise the different gestures available in the game."

features : 
- "Allow cars to pass through the crossroad by gesturing to the Kinect."
- "Uses the Oculus Rift DK1 and a headset so that you really think you're at the T-junction!"
- "Featured at Microsoft TechDays 2015."
