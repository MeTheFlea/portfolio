title : PlayStation 4 Arkanoid Clone
tech: 
- C++
- Native PS4
- PSSL

sections : 
 Description :
 - "A small arkanoid clone for the PlayStation 4 using sample code and documentation as reference. The goal here was to learn how to develop on the PlayStation 4 without using an engine such as the PhyreEngine. A lot of PS4 specific features have also been implemented just to see how that would work (such as changing the lightbar colour and using the touchpad)."
 - "Though not my first experience with developing for the PlayStation 4 (I had previously worked on a group project using the PhyreEngine), this was an incredibly useful learning experience as I was not using a premade engine, but instead creating a small game using the PS4 samples available as reference."

features : 
- "Controller lightbar colour changes based on last hit block colour."
- "Use the Dualshock 4 SixAxis to orient the camera."
- "Use the Dualshock 4 touchpad to select a power to use."
- "Controller vibrates when a block gets hit."
- "PSSL shader with support for multiple light-sources."
- "Picture-in-picture."
- "Drop in-and-out 2-player local multiplayer support."
