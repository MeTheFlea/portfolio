 About Me :
 - "My name is Martin Stuurwold and I'm a programmer. I've been working with <strong>C++</strong> for just over three years now, and it is my language of choice for most of my projects. For my personal projects, I have extensively used modern <strong>OpenGL</strong> to render graphics, and have written a lot of shaders in <strong>GLSL</strong> including creating <strong>compute shaders</strong> to execute general-purpose code on the GPU. Over the years I've also gained a lot of experience using 3D engines such as <strong>Unity3D</strong> in which I code scripts using <strong>C#</strong>."

 - "I have also experimented a bit with <strong>DirectX</strong>, including <strong>HLSL</strong>. <strong>Android</strong> devices are no mystery to me either, as I have fiddled around with creating native applications in <strong>Java</strong>.
 I have also been fortunate enough to have experience working on the <strong>PlayStation 4</strong>, creating a simple project extended from Sony's samples, as well as creating a game as a group using the <strong>Phyre Engine</strong>."

 - "I really enjoy working on <strong>gameplay programming</strong> but most of my hobby projects involve a lot of engine and architecture work, which come with their own interesting challenges. I have worked on plenty of group projects and I love to contribute ideas and cooperate throughout the entire development process."

 - "I currently study at the <em>NHTV Breda University of Applied Sciences</em> in The Netherlands."
